# Example using the OpenTelemetry Operator for Kubernetes

The [OpenTelemetry Operator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/)
(the "Operator") provides a way to manage (a) an OTel Collector and (b) setup
auto-instrumentation of applications in a number of languages in a Kubernetes
cluster.  This directory includes an example Node.js app and shows how to
deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster and instrument it with the Elastic
Distribution of OpenTelemetry for Node.js (EDOT Node.js) using the Operator.

TODO: add README content here. For now see ../../DEVELOPMENT.md notes.
