# Some testing requires using the OpenAI service (api.openai.com):
#
# - `npm run test:regenerate-recordings` uses OpenAI to record responses to
#   specific requests. These recordings are used in subsequent unit test runs
#   (`npm test`).
# - to run integration tests, `npm run test:integration`, against the OpenAI
#   service.
#
# These require OpenAI credentials. One option is to:
#
# 1. copy this template to "openai.env" and fill in your auth details, then
# 2. set `TEST_FIXTURES_ENV_FILE=./openai.env`. This envvar is loaded by the
#    test file that runs the integration tests.
#
# Then this will run the integration tests against OpenAI:
#   TEST_FIXTURES_ENV_FILE=./openai.env npm run test:integration
