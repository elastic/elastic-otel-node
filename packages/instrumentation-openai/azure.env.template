# To run the integration tests against the Azure OpenAI service requires
# a few things:
# - An Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key.
# - That endpoint needs to be configured with two deployments, one with a GenAI
#   model that supports tool calls, e.g. "gpt-4o-mini", and one that supports
#   embeddings, e.g. "test-embedding-3-small".
#
# One option is to:
#
# 1. copy this template to "azure.env" and fill in the variables below, then
# 2. set `TEST_FIXTURES_ENV_FILE=./azure.env`. This envvar is loaded by the
#    test file that runs the integration tests.
#
# Then this will run the integration tests against Azure OpenAI:
#   TEST_FIXTURES_ENV_FILE=./azure.env npm run test:integration

# For tests to pass, the Azure OpenAI resource pointed to by
# AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT needs to have deployments with the same names as the
# `openaiChatModel` and `openaiEmbeddingsModel` values in
# "test/testconfig.json".
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://YOUR_RESOURCE_NAME.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=...

# Using `openai.AzureOpenAI` requires the API version to be set. You can
# use this or a different value.
